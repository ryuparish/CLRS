We do? I am definitely confused about this question.
You need to set the prev and next if you want the list to be able to changeorder in which it is traversed.

If you wanted to, you could implement it so that it would only travel in a certain path, then you would just check for None and then not print it if it was a None value that occupied the Value spot. But then, your linked list would always run in O(n) time, where n is the size of the linked list.
