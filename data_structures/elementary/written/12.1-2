The binary-search-tree property and the min heap property differ because the min-heap property does not allow child nodes that are equivalent, they must be greater than the parent node's value.

It would be very difficult (I think) to have the min heap property tree print out a sorted list. You would not be able to use the same recursive function as you would in a binary search tree.
